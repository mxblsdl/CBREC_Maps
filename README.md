# Creating Maps of Timber Harvest Model Outputs

In support of the CBREC modeling work. Maps to create are outlined below. 

## 4 maps: of CO2e emissions (GTP and GWP basis).

### Scenarios:
a. Actual treatment. 50% piled, All Tech Recoverable collected, Pile & Broadcast reference

b. Actual treatment. 50% piled, All Tech Recoverable collected, No burn reference

## 8 maps: PM 2.5, NOx, SOx, and CH4 emissions maps. Same scenario.

a. Where reference case is Rx burn, net scenario emissions are Year 1 use case emissions â€“ year 1 reference case emissions

b. Where reference case is no burn, net scenario emissions are Year 1 use case -  average annual reference case emission over the first 10 years

## Units
MT emission/MT residue
kg emission/MWh for the respective figures.
